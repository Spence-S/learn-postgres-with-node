# Learning PGsQL

This is the implementation of the udemy course "SQL boot camp", implemented in a node
app.

I haven't thought of the structure yet, probably a route for every statement exercise.

I am using the [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) package to write bare minimum
SQL queries as I learn.

I will put this in more detail soon.
